    <h2>Letra</h2>
    <p>
    You know this boogie is for real...<br>
    I used to put my faith in worship<br>
    But then my chance to get to Heaven slipped<br>
    I used to worry about the future<br>
    But then I threw my caution to the wind<br>
    I had no reason to be carefree - no, no, no<br>
    Until I took a trip to the other side of town - yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
    You know I heard that boogie rhythm<br>
    Hey! I had no choice but to get down, down, down, down<br>
    Dance!<br>
    Nothing left for me to do but dance<br>
    Off these bad times I'm going through, just dance<br>
    Got canned heat in my heels, tonight, baby<br>
    I feel the thunder, see the lightning<br>
    I know this anger's Heaven-sent<br>
    So I've got to hang out all my hang-ups<br>
    'Cause on the boogie, I feel so Hell-bent, hey, hey<br>
    It's just an instant gut reaction, that I get<br>
    I know I've never, ever felt like this before<br>
    I don't know what to do<br>
    But, man, that's nothing new<br>
    Stuck between Hell and high water<br>
    I need a cure to make it through, hey!<br>
